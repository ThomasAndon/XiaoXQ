              <strong>1. General</strong><br>
              <br>
              1.1 The following End User License Agreement ("EULA") represents the contractual conditions between you ("Licensee") and NiceKeys GmbH, Schlesische Str. 29-30, 10997 Berlin, Germany ("NiceKeys") for the use of software including related media, documentation (for example program descriptions, manuals) and other documents and materials manufactured by NiceKeys ("Product(s)").<br>
              <br>
              1.2 By installing and by registering the software on your computer, you declare yourself in agreement with these conditions. If you do not agree with these conditions, you must not install the software. In this case, and provided you purchased a boxed product,  you have the opportunity to return the complete Product (including all written matter, packaging and similar material) to the dealer from whom it was originally bought within 14 (fourteen) days after the day of purchase. For respective purchases from the NiceKeys Online Shop, please contact our customer support (easy to use forms can be found on our website) for returning the complete Product (including all written matter, packaging and similar material). The price you paid will be refunded in full.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>2. Registration / Activation</strong><br>
              <br>
              2.1 You need to download the NiceKeys software tool "Native Access”, create an account, and then register the Licensed Software with the provided serial number. It is not possible to use NiceKeys Products that are not activated beyond the so-called “demo mode” (up to 15/30minutes use).<br>
              <br>
              2.2 Registration requires an internet connection. You need to enter your name and email address. These data are stored together with the NiceKeys serial number in our registration database.<br>

              <br>
              2.3 The NiceKeys activation uses information about essential system components of your computer, and encodes this information in a "Activation Request Code". This information does not include any personal data. The Activation Request Code is used to create an activation key, which works only on the computer where the Activation Request Code has been generated.<br>
              <br>
              2.4 If you want to use your NiceKeys Product on a different device, or if you make extensive changes to your device, you may need to re-activate your NiceKeys Product.<br>
              <br>
              2.5 If you purchased a third-party software product, you agree that NiceKeys makes your registration data available to the third-party. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>3. Scope of Use</strong><br>
              <br>
              3.1 The Products from NiceKeys are protected by law. The intellectual property of the Products remains at NiceKeys. Licensee acquires only the right to use the Product to the following extent. Any other use or exploitation not explicitly granted to Licensee in this EULA shall not be allowed without written consent from NiceKeys. Specifically, Licensee is not entitled to copy or have copied, decompile or have decompiled, reverse engineer or have reverse engineered the Product or parts thereof. Licensee must ensure by appropriate and reasonable steps that third parties, including its own employees, cannot make unauthorized use of the Product. Licensee shall be liable to NiceKeys for any loss or damage in this context.<br>
              <br>
              3.2 NiceKeys grants Licensee the non-exclusive right without restrictions in time or place to use the Products. NiceKeys is not obliged to cede the software underlying source code, including the associated development documentation.<br>
              <br>
              3.3 Licensee may install and personally use the licensed software on three devices (e.g. one computer, one laptop, one workstation), provided that the said software is used only on one device regularly. Simultaneous use on more than one hardware device is not permitted. The Products may not be used on a network by multiple users, unless each user possesses a license. In case Licensee changes the hardware, all software on the hardware used must be deleted.<br>
              <br>
              3.4 Licensee may copy the licensed software, if such reproduction is necessary for the contractually agreed use. Licensee is authorized to create a backup, if this is necessary to secure the future use.<br>

              b) Any Products from NiceKeys labeled or otherwise provided to you as "NFR" (Not For Resale) shall only be used for demonstration, testing and evaluation purposes. NFR Products must not be resold or transferred. NFR Products are exempt from update, upgrade or crossgrade offers, and cannot be purchased with or exchanged for vouchers or coupons. Furthermore, as an owner of a NFR Product, you are not entitled to any vouchers that ship with the standard version of the Product.<br>
              c) Any Products from NiceKeys labeled or otherwise provided to you as an “EDU” (Educational) version shall only be used by students or those working in educational institutions.

              <br>
              Some content included in NiceKeys Products, as well as any associated intellectual property rights and titles, belongs to third parties, maybe protected by copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.<br>

              <br>
              <strong>5. Duties to Protect</strong><br>

              <strong>6. Warranty, Legal Liability, Damages</strong><br>

              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>7. Final Provisions</strong><br>
              <br>
              7.1 If any stipulation of this EULA should be or become invalid, either completely or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining stipulations. The parties undertake instead to replace the invalid stipulation with a valid regulation which comes as close as possible to the purpose originally intended.<br>
              <br>
              7.2 Insofar as Licensee is a merchant within the meaning of the German Commercial Code (HGB) or corporate body under public law or special fund under public law the place of jurisdiction and place of performance is Berlin, Germany. However, NiceKeys reserves the right to sue Licensee at Licensee's place of residence or place of business.<br>
              <br>
              7.3 This EULA is subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CSIG), whereas consumers regularly residing abroad may as well rely on mandatory applicable laws of the state where they are a resident. The contractual language is German insofar as nothing else is agreed upon in writing.<br>
              <br>
